What is autopycoin
#####################################

Autopycoin is a project from french IT students. It is a Python library that provides deep learning models and various derived objects (such as dataset generator, plot functions, losses and metrics)
in order to analyse time series and make predictions. At the core of the Autopycoin package, is the tensorflow operations.

The power, the speed and the large ecosysteme of tensorflow make it an indispensable toolkit.

This package has been designed to save hundreds of hours of work in the preparation of temporal data. 
This kind of problem is very pernicious because data leakage often happens.
However, many other packages offer similar work. Then we wanted to add another dimension to this project.
This package will also focus on cryptocurrency, we will not only implement regression model but also reinforcement
 and classification algorithm.
